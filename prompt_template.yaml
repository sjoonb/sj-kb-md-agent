      </file_list>
      <query>
        {query}
      </query>
    </input>

    Given the above list of manual titles, predict which manual is most likely to contain information related to the provided query.
    Provide your response in the following XML format:

    <response>
      <reasoning>
        A brief explanation of why you chose this manual
      </reasoning>
      <file_name>
        The exact name of the chosen manual from the list
      </file_name>
    </response>

    If none of the manuals seem likely to contain relevant information, respond with:

    <response>
      <reasoning>
        None of the available manuals appear to contain relevant information for this query.
      </reasoning>
      <file_name>
        null
      </file_name>

  faq_search_prompt: |
    <input>
      <indexed_questions>
        {indexed_questions}
      </indexed_questions>
      <query>
        {query}
      </query>
    </input>
    Given the above list of indexed FAQ questions and the user query, your task is to find the most appropriate question by matching the query to the questions in the list. Here are two examples showing how to handle matching and non-matching cases:

    Example 1 (Matching Case):
    User Query: "토큰이 중복 발급되었을 경우 어떻게 되나요?"
    Indexed Questions:
    0: 자격증명과 접근토큰의 차이가 무엇인지?
    1: 토큰이 중복발급되었을 때 그 처리 절차는?
    Correct Response:
    <response>
      <match_found>true</match_found>
      <reasoning>
        The user's query "토큰이 중복 발급되었을 경우 어떻게 되나요?" (What happens if tokens are issued duplicately?) is semantically very similar to the question at index 1: "토큰이 중복발급되었을 때 그 처리 절차는?" (What is the procedure when tokens are issued duplicately?). Both questions deal with the situation of duplicate token issuance. The user is asking about what happens in this situation, and the question at index 1 specifically asks about the procedure for handling this, making it the most appropriate match. In contrast, the question at index 0 is about the difference between credentials and access tokens, which is not relevant to the user's current query.
      </reasoning>
      <index>1</index>
    </response>

    Example 2 (Non-Matching Case):
    User Query: "개인정보 삭제는 어떻게 하나요?"
    Indexed Questions:
    0: 정보 전송 요구 연장은 언제 가능한가요?
    1: 자격증명과 접근토큰의 차이가 무엇인지?
    Correct Response:
    <response>
      <match_found>false</match_found>
      <reasoning>
        The user query "개인정보 삭제는 어떻게 하나요?" is asking about how to delete personal information. However, none of the questions in the list are related to deleting personal information. The available questions are about extending data transmission requests and the difference between credentials and access tokens. Therefore, there is no appropriate match in the given FAQ list.
      </reasoning>
      <index>null</index>
    </response>

    Now, follow these steps to find the most appropriate question for the given query:
    1. Carefully analyze the user's query, identifying key terms and intent.
    2. Compare the user's query with each question in the indexed list. Look for exact matches or high semantic similarity.
    3. If you find a matching or highly similar question, return its index.
    4. If there's no matching or highly similar question, return null as the index.

    Provide your response in the following XML format:
    <response>
      <match_found>true or false</match_found>
      <reasoning>
        Detailed explanation of why you chose this FAQ entry or why no match was found.
        Include your comparison process and explain why other questions were not suitable.
      </reasoning>
      <index>
        The index of the chosen FAQ entry, or null if no match was found
      </index>
    </response>

    Important notes:
    1. Ensure your response is in valid XML format without any additional markers or delimiters.
    2. Never return content that is not directly related to the query. If no relevant match is found, always return null as the index.
    3. Prioritize accuracy over providing an answer. It's better to return null than to provide an incorrect or unrelated index.
    4. Focus on matching the user's query with the questions in the indexed list.
    5. Do not wrap the XML in any kind of code block or use any markdown formatting.
